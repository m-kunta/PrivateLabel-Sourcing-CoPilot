# PL Sourcing Co-Pilot

**A Private Label Supply Chain Intelligence Platform**

> "If the Panama Canal transit capacity drops by 30%, how does that ripple through our cocoa butter and furniture component lead times?"

**PL Sourcing Co-Pilot** is a RAG-powered AI prototype that answers strategic supply chain "what-if" questions for private label buyers. It combines a Pinecone vector knowledge base (vendor lead times + live disruption news) with an LLM reasoning chain to generate risk-ranked component tables and professional analyst briefings — in seconds.

## How to Use

### The Problem in One Sentence

Private label buying teams have **no rapid way to answer "what-if" disruption questions** — _"If Savannah strikes next week, which of our 40+ sourced components are at risk, and by how many days?"_ — before shelf gaps materialise and emergency air freight bills arrive.

### How This Solution Demonstrates the Answer

The Co-Pilot closes that gap in three steps:

1. **Stores institutional knowledge** — vendor lead times, shipping routes, and route-vulnerability flags — in a Pinecone vector database so the system understands _why_ a Panama Canal drought affects Asia-East Coast apparel but not West Africa cocoa.
2. **Reasons over a disruption scenario** — an LLM acting as a Principal Supply Chain Strategist applies heuristic disruption coefficients, traces second-order ripple effects, and risk-classifies every affected component (🔴 Red / 🟡 Yellow / 🟢 Green).
3. **Delivers a decision-ready briefing** — executive summary, key findings, recommended actions, and a risk horizon — in seconds, formatted for a VP of Merchandising.

### Quick-Start Steps

> **No Pinecone account?** Skip steps 3–5 — the app runs in **fallback mode** using `data/vendor_lead_times.csv` directly. Results are structurally identical.

**1. Install**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Configure**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set LLM_PROVIDER and the matching API key.
# Optionally set PINECONE_API_KEY for full RAG mode.
```

**3. Generate lead time data**
```bash
python data_gen.py          # creates data/vendor_lead_times.csv
```

**4. Launch the dashboard**
```bash
streamlit run app.py        # opens at http://localhost:8501
```

**5. (Full RAG mode only) Ingest data**

In the **Data Hub** tab: click **Initialize Pinecone Index → Ingest Lead Times → Ingest Disruptions**.

**6. Run a scenario**

Go to the **Scenario Analyzer** tab and try one of these:
- *"Panama Canal transit drops 30% — which furniture components are at risk?"*
- *"Savannah port strike declared — which private label components are affected?"*
- Use the **🔴 Hormuz Toggle** to model the 2026 Strait of Hormuz geopolitical scenario instantly.

The output is a ranked risk table + an analyst briefing you can share directly with your buying team.

## The Problem

Private label teams at large retailers (Target, Costco, Walmart, Kroger) source raw materials directly from global suppliers under their own brand labels — True brand cotton, Frederick's cocoa butter, Casa Home wood pulp. These buyers face a structurally harder sourcing problem than branded goods buyers:

1. **No buffer from brand-name intermediaries.** When a Port of Savannah strike delays a container ship, the private label cocoa butter buyer has no Nestlé procurement team shielding them. They absorb the delay directly.

2. **Multi-tier opacity.** A cocoa butter shipment from Tema (Ghana) → Savannah → Baltimore touches three ocean freight legs, two consolidation points, and a trucking move. Each node can fail independently.

3. **Asymmetric information.** Disruption news (Red Sea shipping reroutes, Panama Canal draft restrictions, West Africa cocoa harvest failure) is public but fragmented across freight news outlets, government advisories, and commodity reports. No private label team has the bandwidth to monitor and synthesize all of it.

4. **Ripple-effect blindness.** A Savannah port slowdown doesn't just delay cotton — it delays the *spandex fiber*, the *thread*, and the *elastic trim* that all travel on the same East Coast lanes, affecting finished apparel in ways that aren't visible until shelf gaps appear.

5. **Static lead time data.** Most buying teams work from spreadsheets with "standard lead times" that were last updated years ago and don't account for current route conditions.

### The Cost

- **Out-of-Stock Penalties:** Retail private label OOS (Out-of-Shelf) costs are estimated at 4–8% of annual category revenue.
- **Emergency Air Freight:** Expedited air freight to cover a missed ocean shipment costs 6–10× the ocean rate.
- **Markdown Risk:** Late raw material arrivals compress production schedules, forcing buyers into off-peak manufacturing slots at premium costs.
- **Brand Credibility:** Private label is a loyalty driver. A consumer who can't find "True" brand organic cotton tees switches to a national brand — and may not come back.

## The Approach

PL Sourcing Co-Pilot addresses this problem with a three-layer architecture:

### Layer 1: Vector Knowledge Base (Pinecone RAG)

Two namespaces in a Pinecone serverless index store the "institutional memory" of the sourcing operation:

**`lead_times` namespace** — Historical vendor lead time records, semantically indexed:
- Vendor + brand name, component, origin country/port, destination port
- Transport mode, shipping route, base lead days, historical variance %
- Route vulnerability flags (Panama Canal, Suez Canal, Savannah port, West Africa port exposure)

**`disruptions` namespace** — Live and curated disruption intelligence:
- Parsed from supply chain RSS feeds (Reuters, FreightWaves, maritime advisories)
- Pre-loaded with 10 curated mock events for demo/offline use
- Each event tagged with: event type, affected routes, severity (High/Medium/Low), date

When a user asks a question, the engine retrieves the *semantically most relevant* lead time records and disruption events — not a keyword match, but a contextual understanding of what "Panama Canal" means for "Asia-East Coast furniture components."

### Layer 2: Scenario Reasoning Engine (`StrategicAnalystChain`)

The retrieved context is passed to an LLM (configurable: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Groq, or local Ollama) acting as a **Principal Supply Chain Strategist**. The LLM:

1. **Identifies** the primary disruption type and which shipping routes it affects.
2. **Applies a Disruption Coefficient** to base lead times (heuristically grounded):
   - Panama Canal transit drop → +15–40% on Asia-East Coast routes
   - Port of Savannah work action → +30–60% on all East Coast East imports
   - Suez Canal disruption → +20–45% on Europe/Asia routes (adds ~14 days for Cape of Good Hope reroute)
   - West Africa port congestion → +15–30% on cocoa/palm oil lanes
3. **Traces the Ripple Effect** — e.g., a Savannah strike doesn't just hit cotton; it hits spandex fiber, recycled PET packaging, and palm oil that all clear the same port.
4. **Risk-Classifies** each component (Red / Yellow / Green) based on adjusted lead time vs. baseline.
5. **Generates a professional briefing** with executive summary, key findings, and recommended actions.

The engine is designed to **gracefully degrade**: if Pinecone is not configured, it applies the heuristic coefficient table directly to the CSV data without vector search.

### Layer 3: Streamlit Decision-Support UI

Three functional tabs:

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Scenario Analyzer** | Enter a "what-if" question, set disruption magnitude, get risk table + briefing. Features the **"Hormuz" Event Toggle** for 2026 geopolitical fuel/routing modeling. |
| **Risk Dashboard** | Visual overview of all components by risk exposure and lead time |
| **Data Hub** | Ingest/refresh lead time CSV and disruption news into Pinecone |

## Key Concepts

### Disruption Coefficient

The disruption coefficient (`d`) is a multiplier applied to base lead times to estimate the adjusted lead time under a disruption scenario:

```
adjusted_lead_days = base_lead_days × d(disruption_type, magnitude_pct)
```

Heuristic baseline coefficients (grounded in historical freight data):

| Disruption Type | Coefficient | Basis |
|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| Panama Canal capacity -30% | 1.35 | Transit queue buildup; reroute adds 7–10 days |
| Panama Canal capacity -50% | 1.55 | Severe queuing; partial Suez reroute |
| Port of Savannah work action | 1.50 | Historical ILWU/ILA work-to-rule adds 15–20 days |
| Suez Canal closure (Red Sea) | 1.40 | Cape of Good Hope detour adds ~14 days |
| West Africa port congestion | 1.25 | Tema/Abidjan congestion typical +5–8 days |
| Bangladesh flooding | 1.30 | Chittagong inland road disruption +7–12 days |
| Strait of Hormuz Blockage | 1.45 | Massive fuel surcharge spike (+15-30% costs) and extensive Middle East rerouting |

The LLM reasons about the coefficient contextually — e.g., a Panama Canal disruption has a higher coefficient for furniture (heavy, slow transit, bulk cargo) than for textiles (can reroute via air at marginal cost).

### Ripple Effect

A single port disruption rarely affects a single component. The engine maps downstream impacts:

```
Savannah Port Strike
  ├── Cotton (True brand) ──► Delayed → apparel production schedule at risk
  ├── Spandex Fiber ──────────► Delayed → athletic wear line impacted
  ├── Recycled PET ───────────► Delayed → packaging for all private label lines
  └── Palm Oil ──────────────► Delayed → personal care manufacturing delay
```

The LLM is explicitly prompted to enumerate second-order effects when generating its briefing.

### Risk Zones

| Zone | Condition | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 🔴 Red | adjusted_lead_days > base × 1.35 | Alert buyer; activate dual-source or air freight contingency |
| 🟡 Yellow | adjusted_lead_days > base × 1.15 | Monitor closely; pre-position safety stock |
| 🟢 Green | adjusted_lead_days ≤ base × 1.15 | Normal operations |

- One LLM API key: Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, or Groq (Ollama works with no key)

### Installation

```bash
cd /Users/MKunta/CODE/pl_sourcing_copilot

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

**Required in `.env`:**
```env
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_key_here
LLM_PROVIDER=Anthropic          # or OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, Ollama
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Optional Alternative LLM Keys (depending on your `LLM_PROVIDER` choice):**
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key_here
```

### Supported LLM Providers

| Provider | Python Package | Cost | Default Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic** | `anthropic` | Paid | `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` |
| **OpenAI** | `openai` | Paid | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| **Gemini** | `google-genai` | Free Tier | `gemini-2.5-flash` |

| **Ollama** | `ollama` | Free (Local) | `llama3.2` |

### Data Initialization

```bash
# Step 1: Generate synthetic lead time data
python data_gen.py
# → Creates data/vendor_lead_times.csv (50 rows)

# Step 2: Launch the dashboard
streamlit run app.py
```

**Step 3: Ingest Data via UI**
1. Open the app in your browser (usually `http://localhost:8501`)
2. Navigate to the **Data Hub** tab.
3. Click the **"Initialize Pinecone Index"** button.
4. Click **"Ingest Lead Times"** and **"Ingest Disruptions"** to load the data into the vector database.

> *Alternatively, you can run the initialization scripts via the CLI if you prefer, but the UI is the recommended path for first-time setup.*

---

## Demo Without Pinecone

The app works in **fallback mode** without a Pinecone API key — it applies the heuristic disruption coefficient table directly to `data/vendor_lead_times.csv`. Scenario results will be accurate in structure but won't benefit from semantic retrieval or live disruption context.

To run in fallback mode: just omit `PINECONE_API_KEY` from `.env`.

---

## Example Scenarios

```
"If the Panama Canal transit drops by 30%, how are furniture component lead times affected?"

"A port strike is declared at Savannah. Which of our private label components are at risk?"

"West Africa cocoa yield has dropped 25% due to El Niño. How does this affect cocoa butter supply?"

"If Red Sea shipping is suspended and Suez Canal routes are impacted, which routes are forced
 around the Cape of Good Hope and by how many days?"

"Which of our apparel components have the highest combined risk from Panama Canal + Savannah exposure?"

"With the 2026 tensions escalating, what is the fuel surcharge and transit delay impact on our Asian imports if the Strait of Hormuz is blocked?"
```
